# The Spartonics Repository
### Team 2141

####Introduction

This is the official Github repository for the De La Salle and Carondelet robotics team Spartonics, or FRC team 2141. We program in Java with the WPILIB plugins in eclipse and our Github utilization is through the Egit plugin. Please feel free to look through our code or Fork it and use it with your own robots!

####Active Code

Currently we are using the 2017 Code files as the primary projects. Anything labeled with prototype is for prototyping. Feel free to use any of them.

####Installation

1. To install verify that the Egit plugin is up to date by going to the eclipse help tab and navigating to the Eclipse Marketplace. In the installed tab Egit should show that it is up to date, or requries an update. 

2. Go to the window tab and hover on perspective. Then click open perspective then other and chose Git and confirm. On the top right of Eclipse navigate to the Git tab. 

3. You should be presented with the choice to add or clone a repository. Click on clone a repository and where it says URL enter: https://github.com/Bernstern/Spartonics-2141.git. The rest should autofill besides user and password. There put in your Github username and password and select store in secure store. 

4. In branch selection choose the master branch **only** (The other branches are for pull requests and other users). Now that the top says local destination select *Finish*.

5. Now (still in the git perspective) navigate the branches tab and right click on it. You will be presented the option to *switch to*. Click on new brach and enter your name.  You should have a new local branch named *your name*.

6. Now navigate to the working tree and expand it. Go to the desired coding project and right click it and choose Import Project. In the wizard make sure that *import existing Eclipse projects* is selected. If there is an error saying that the project already exists in the workspace just press cancel and move on to step 7. If it doesn't select the project and click finish.
