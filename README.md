# The Spartonics Repository
# Team 2141

Introduction

This is the official Github repository for the De La Salle and Carondelet robotics team Spartonics, or FRC team 2141. We program in Java with the WPILIB plugins in eclipse and our Github utilization is through the Egit plugin. Please feel free to look through our code or Fork it and use it with your own robots!

Currently we are using the 2017 Code files as the primary projects. Anything labeled with prototype is for prototyping. Feel free to use any of them.

3. You should be presented with the choice to add or clone a repository. Click on clone a repository and where it says URL enter: https://github.com/Bernstern/Spartonics-2141.git. The rest should autofill besides user and password. There put in your Github username and password and select store in secure store.

Submitting your work

1. At the end of the day any files you made a change to will look similar to this: >Robot.Java. Select all the files you would like to submit for review by right clicking the files and navigating to the team tab (towards the bottom) and selecting add to index.

2. Somewhere on your Eclipse page should have a Git staging tab, navigate to it. All your changes you want to push should be in the Staged Changes tab. Add a commit message describing what you are adding or removing. The more descriptive the faster your changes can be approved. Verify that the Author is you and press commit and push!
