# Get Started 
This is a general guide to getting started with visual studio and how to start your own robot project in Java. 

### Installing VS Code
Go to [link](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/getting_started/l/999999-installing-c-and-java-development-tools-for-frc "this link") to find the complete instructions to install vs code with the WPI lib plugins to your desktop. Note, this cannot use a pre-installed version of vs code so it will create a second directory if one already exists. In this install java should be installed but if not download the latest Java JDK for your OS and set your Path variable to that install, if that was in French check link 2. 

### Adding Libraries to Your Project
If you're planning to use TalonSRX's, SparkMaxs or an IMU, you're gonna need more libraries to get everything working. For them check link 3 to add them to the project

### Driver Station Install
If you want to use driver station you will need to install the FRC update suite, to do so use link 4 and email me for the organization's code to install everything you need. 

### Rio image busted, Radio acting funky?
Do you need to update either to competition specs? Link 5 and 6 pal.

### Do you need to check your can devices?
For some reason the FRC gods have deemed it worthy to yank this off the web dashboard so you need to check your CAN devices using either the Poenix tuner provided by CTRE or the Spark MAX Client provided by Rev, they are links 7 and 8 respectively.
